summary: Introducing a novel framework for learning graph representations while incorporating uncertainty modelling.
abstract: "This talk will give an overview of our incoming NeurIPS submission. We present a framework for learning to represent graph-structured data under uncertainty and evaluate it on a series of existing and novel tasks. The latter include Cellular Automata and a subset of Cora-full for mixed-class and few-shot learning, whereas the existing data comes from geometric and biological domains."
