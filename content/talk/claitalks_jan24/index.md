summary: An overview of text-and-audio methods that supports the Multimodal Learning module in [R255](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/2324/R255/).
abstract: "This talk supports the R255 Advanced Topics in Machine Learning course module on Multimodal Learning and provides a birdâ€™s eye view of the rapidly evolving text-audio landscape, with a focus on music as a primary example of audio data. I will first present types of tasks that exist in this space, then discuss data curation challenges and follow with an overview of some existing retrieval and generation methods, including a quick primer on diffusion models. Finally, I will describe current evaluation metrics and their limitations."
