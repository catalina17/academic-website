summary: An overview of several graph generation and probabilistic approaches, part of the R250 MPhil course at the Cambridge CS department.
abstract: "This short lecture will present three different approaches to graph generation from the ML literature, using a variety of techniques based on deep learning and probabilistic building blocks. We will then cover the motivation for incorporating uncertainty when making predictions and briefly discuss a novel approach to learning graph representations that achieves this."
