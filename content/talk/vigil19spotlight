summary: Overview of the VideoNavQA study that was recently published at BMVC 2019.
abstract: "This talk will be a short intro to our recent paper, [VideoNavQA: Bridging the Gap between Visual and Embodied Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.04950). Here, we investigate the feasibility of EQA -type tasks by building a novel benchmark, which contains pairs of questions and videos generated in the House3D environment. While removing the navigation and action selection requirements from EQA , we increase the difficulty of the visual reasoning component via a much larger question space, tackling the sort of complex reasoning questions that make QA tasks challenging. By designing and evaluating several VQA -style models on the dataset, we establish a novel way of evaluating EQA feasibility given existing methods, while highlighting the difficulty of the problem even in the most ideal setting."
