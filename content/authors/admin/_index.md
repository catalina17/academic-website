I am a second-year PhD student within the [Artificial Intelligence Group](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/ai/) of the [Department of Computer Science and Technology](https://cst.cam.ac.uk) (formerly known as the Computer Laboratory). My research focuses on learning from complex-structured data in multimodal and relational settings. I am supervised by [Pietro Liò](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pl219/) and affiliated with [King's College](https://www.kings.cam.ac.uk). I was the chair of [women@CL](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/women) in 2018-19 and am deputy chair for 2019-20.
