I am a Quantitative Researcher at [Qube Research & Technologies](https://www.qube-rt.com/), previously co-lead of Generative Music at [Google DeepMind](http://deepmind.com). I have 9 years of ML experience and an extensive background in computer science and competitive programming.

I like to solve problems in the real world using my ML expertise and thrive in collaborative environments where everyone works towards a shared agenda. Music is my lifelong passion - I've brought essential contributions to [AI tools](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/transforming-the-future-of-music-creation/) that support the creative process of making music. I was part of the core Lyria and Music AI Sandbox teams and GDM tech lead for the YouTube Dream Track quality workstream.

My PhD at King's College, University of Cambridge was awarded with no thesis corrections. I also earned a First Class BA and an MPhil with Distinction from Cambridge. During my studies, I interned at Big Tech and startup companies, top research labs in academia and industry. Since graduate years, I've mentored and taught for 100s of hours. I love giving demos, talks or lectures and always get positive energy from a room full of people!

Outside work, I love rowing, travelling, playing rock/jazz guitar and chasing bands on tour. ðŸŽ¼ I sometimes write [poetry](https://www.deviantart.com/slowfretboarddancer/gallery/all) and lyrics for (ever-)future songs :)
