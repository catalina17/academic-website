I am a Senior AI researcher, most recently co-lead of Generative Music at [Google DeepMind](http://deepmind.com), with 9 years of ML experience and extensive background in computer science and competitive programming. I love doing purposeful work that helps others! My focus has recently been music generation, finding useful signals in large datasets and human evaluation studies. I've lately had the privilege to be [developing tools](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/transforming-the-future-of-music-creation/) that enable quicker iterations of musical ideas and finding inspiration in unexpected ways!

Outside work, I love cycling, rowing, travelling, playing/recording the piano/guitar and chasing my favourite bands on tour. ðŸŽ¼ I sometimes write [poetry](https://www.deviantart.com/slowfretboarddancer/gallery/all) and lyrics for (ever-)future songs :)
