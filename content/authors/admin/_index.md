I am a third-year PhD student at the [Department of Computer Science and Technology](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk), [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk), supervised by [Pietro LiÃ²](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pl219/) and affiliated with [King's College](https://www.kings.cam.ac.uk). My research focuses on learning multimodal and graph-structured representations of the world. Currently, I am a Research Scientist Intern at [DeepMind](http://deepmind.com), working with [Piotr Mirowski](https://piotrmirowski.com/) and [Raia Hadsell](http://raiahadsell.com/).

My professional experience includes undergraduate Software Engineering internships at Google and Facebook, continuing with a research internship at [Mila](http://mila.quebec) and an AI Residency at [X](http://x.company). Recently, I was also a graph ML consultant for [Relation Therapeutics](https://www.relationrx.com/).

I also have a great passion for teaching and am constantly involved in academic and departmental activities - supervising undergraduate courses, final year projects and master's research projects (+200h and ~60 students), interviewing Computer Science applicants, chairing [women@CL](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/women) and introducing professionals to Machine Learning concepts as a [Cambridge Spark](https://cambridgespark.com/) teaching fellow. 

In my "free" (and non-lockdown) time, I row with the Women's First Boat in King's College, play guitar/sing in a rock band and chase my favourite bands on tour. ðŸŽ¼
