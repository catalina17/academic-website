I am a Research Scientist at [DeepMind](http://deepmind.com), part of the Deep Learning team. I previously completed my PhD at the [Department of Computer Science and Technology](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk), [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk), supervised by [Prof Pietro LiÃ²](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pl219/) and a member of [King's College](https://www.kings.cam.ac.uk). My PhD thesis received no corrections during the viva and is available [here](https://doi.org/10.17863/CAM.72490).

In my undergraduate summer holidays, I gained SWE experience across the stack during internships at Google and Facebook. Later, I also worked in various collaborative research environments: [Mila](http://mila.quebec), [X](http://x.company), [Relation Therapeutics](https://www.relationrx.com/) and [DeepMind](http://deepmind.com). The research focused on (multimodal) navigation or graph ML and resulted in publications, patents and codebases used further in internal projects. I have also contributed to the wider research community, co-organising the [ViGIL workshop](https://vigilworkshop.github.io/) at [NAACL 2021](https://2021.naacl.org/).

Teaching has been a great passion of mine, which I am maintaining outside academia by delivering tutorials and supervising projects at ML summer schools. At Cambridge, I supervised ~60 students for +200h for undergraduate courses and dissertations and Master's research projects, interviewed CS applicants, chaired [women@CL](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/women) and introduced professionals to ML concepts as a [Cambridge Spark](https://cambridgespark.com/) Teaching Fellow. I also prepared and delivered Master's courses practicals (in [2018](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/1718/L42/), [2019](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/1819/L42/)) and graph ML seminars ([R250](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/2021/R250/) in [2020](https://catalinacangea.netlify.app/talk/r250_jan20/) and [2021](https://catalinacangea.netlify.app/talk/r250_feb21/)).

Outside work, I love [rowing](https://uk.virginmoneygiving.com/fundraiser-display/showROFundraiserPage?userUrl=KingsW1&isTeam=true), travelling, playing/recording the piano/guitar and chasing my favourite bands on tour. ðŸŽ¼ I sometimes [write poetry](https://www.deviantart.com/slowfretboarddancer/gallery/all) and take up [cycling](https://ridefortomorrow.redcross.org.uk/fundraising/ccs-410k-for-british-red-cross) challenges!
