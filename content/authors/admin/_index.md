I am a Senior Research Scientist at [Google DeepMind](http://deepmind.com) with a background in machine learning, computer science and competitive programming. I love doing purposeful work that helps others! My focus is on multimodal and generative models, including data and evals. I've been an audio ML enthusiast since 2015!

Previous SWE experience across the stack during internships at Google and Facebook. Also worked in various collaborative research environments: [Mila](http://mila.quebec), [X](http://x.company), [Relation Therapeutics](https://www.relationrx.com/) and [DeepMind](http://deepmind.com). Since graduate years, I've mentored and taught in academia and industry for 100s of hours.

In 2021, I completed [my PhD](https://doi.org/10.17863/CAM.72490) without receiving any corrections at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk), supervised by [Prof Pietro LiÃ²](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pl219/) and a member of [King's College](https://www.kings.cam.ac.uk). I also hold a BA and MPhil in Computer Science from Cambridge.

Outside work, I love cycling, [rowing](https://uk.virginmoneygiving.com/fundraiser-display/showROFundraiserPage?userUrl=KingsW1&isTeam=true), travelling, playing/recording the piano/guitar and chasing my favourite bands on tour. ðŸŽ¼ I sometimes write poetry](https://www.deviantart.com/slowfretboarddancer/gallery/all) and lyrics for (ever-)future songs :)
