I have now passed my PhD viva with ***no corrections*** at the [Department of Computer Science and Technology](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk), [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk)! During my PhD studies, I have been supervised by [Pietro LiÃ²](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pl219/) and a member of [King's College](https://www.kings.cam.ac.uk). My research focuses on learning multimodal and graph-structured representations of the world.

Until November 2020, I was a Research Scientist intern at [DeepMind](http://deepmind.com), hosted by [Piotr Mirowski](https://piotrmirowski.com/) in the Robotics, Embodied Agents and Lifelong learning (REAL) team led by [Raia Hadsell](http://raiahadsell.com/). I am co-organising the [Visually Grounded Interaction and Language Workshop](https://vigilworkshop.github.io/) taking place at [NAACL 2021](https://2021.naacl.org/).

My professional experience includes undergraduate Software Engineering internships at Google and Facebook. During the PhD, I was a Research Intern at [Mila](http://mila.quebec) and an AI Resident at [X](http://x.company). In 2020, I briefly worked for [Relation Therapeutics](https://www.relationrx.com/) as a (graph) ML consultant.

I have a great passion for teaching and am constantly involved in academic and departmental life - supervising undergraduate courses, final year projects and Master's research projects (+200h and ~60 students), interviewing CS applicants, chairing [women@CL](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/women) and introducing professionals to Machine Learning concepts as a [Cambridge Spark](https://cambridgespark.com/) Teaching Fellow. I also helped prepare and deliver Master's courses, both on the practical (L42 Neural Networks in [2018](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/1718/L42/) and [2019](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/1819/L42/)) and theoretical side ([R250](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/2021/R250/) Graph Neural Network seminars in [2020](https://catalinacangea.netlify.app/talk/r250_jan20/) and [2021](https://catalinacangea.netlify.app/talk/r250_feb21/)).

Outside work, I love [rowing with the Women's First Boat in King's College](https://uk.virginmoneygiving.com/fundraiser-display/showROFundraiserPage?userUrl=KingsW1&isTeam=true), travelling, playing the piano/guitar/singing in a rock band and chasing my favourite bands on tour. ðŸŽ¼ I've also recently revived an old habit of [writing poetry](https://www.deviantart.com/slowfretboarddancer/gallery/all) and taken up [cycling](https://ridefortomorrow.redcross.org.uk/fundraising/ccs-410k-for-british-red-cross)!
