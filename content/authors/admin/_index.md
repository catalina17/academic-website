I am a Senior Research Scientist at [Google DeepMind](http://deepmind.com). In 2021, I completed [my PhD](https://doi.org/10.17863/CAM.72490) without receiving any corrections at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk), supervised by [Prof Pietro LiÃ²](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pl219/) and a member of [King's College](https://www.kings.cam.ac.uk).

In my undergraduate summer holidays, I gained SWE experience across the stack during internships at Google and Facebook. Later, I also worked in various collaborative research environments: [Mila](http://mila.quebec), [X](http://x.company), [Relation Therapeutics](https://www.relationrx.com/) and [DeepMind](http://deepmind.com).

At Cambridge, I supervised ~60 students for +200h, interviewed CS applicants, chaired [women@CL](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/women) and was a [Cambridge Spark](https://cambridgespark.com/) Teaching Fellow. I also held [Master's](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/1718/L42/) [practicals](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/1819/L42/) and [graph ML](https://catalinacangea.netlify.app/talk/r250_jan20/) [seminars](https://catalinacangea.netlify.app/talk/r250_feb21/). Since graduating, I have delivered tutorials and supervised projects at ML summer schools.

Outside work, I love [rowing](https://uk.virginmoneygiving.com/fundraiser-display/showROFundraiserPage?userUrl=KingsW1&isTeam=true), travelling, playing/recording the piano/guitar and chasing my favourite bands on tour. ðŸŽ¼ I sometimes [write poetry](https://www.deviantart.com/slowfretboarddancer/gallery/all) and take up [cycling](https://ridefortomorrow.redcross.org.uk/fundraising/ccs-410k-for-british-red-cross) challenges!
